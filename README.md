# dotfiles
My dotfiles managed by chezmoi 

To install:

* Install XCode Select `xcode-select --install` (This may not be needed, but it is certainly needed later on)
* `sh -c "$(curl -fsLS https://chezmoi.io/get)" -- init --apply smbm`
* There will be some post install manual tidying to do:
	1. Sign into 1PW, VSCode, Firefox, Signal etc.
	2. Probably set a bunch of permissions in Settings -> Privacy (Maybe this should be added to the script)

To do: Migrate to Proton Pass
